/*
   Reads NTree (Node Tree) files.  These are files in a custom format somewhat like a simplified YAML, though the NTree
   variation happens to also match the format used by some Unix-like tools such as df, or the format of the file /etc/mtab on Linux.
   Essentially any text file where each entry has its own line and uses whitespace as a delimiter can be read by this class.
   At this time the format is only documented by this code, but that may change in the future.

   Historical Note: This class used to be named IniReader, because the original intent was only to read ini-style files.  Since it
   grew to be more than that, a name change was in order.  Also, there is a different inireader library unrelated to this class.
