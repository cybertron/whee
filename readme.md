Whee is a Qt-based widget engine intended for system monitoring.  It is loosely based on the SuperKaramba application, but without the unfortunate KDE ties that make it work poorly in other environments.  It's also not nearly as powerful as SuperKaramba, but for basic system monitoring it is pretty close in function (I was able to replace all of my SK system monitors using it).

Documentation on using it can be found on the GitHub wiki for this project.
